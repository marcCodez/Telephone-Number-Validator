In this project I created a Telephone Number Validator, it will log true if a valid US phone number has been passed as a string. The following exaples are valid US number formats:
555-555-5555,
(555)555-5555,
(555) 555-5555,
555 555 5555,
5555555555,
1 555 555 5555

You can try the validator via this link on Google Chrome developer tools: https://marccodez.github.io/Telephone-Number-Validator/
